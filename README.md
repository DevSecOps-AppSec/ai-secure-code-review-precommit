# AI Secure Code Review Pre-commit Hook

Runs an **AI-based secure code review** on **staged changes (changed hunks only)** during `git commit`.  
Uses the same `prompt.txt` as your GitHub Action, so PR reviews and local reviews stay consistent.

## Install

1. Add this repo to your projectâ€™s `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
